# [Flexmail](https://flexmail.vercel.app)

Flexmail is a disposable temporary email generator, which can be used for wide range of purposes including protection from spammers.
Because of its privacy-related liberations, we keep the user data and usage stats private. 

* **Why this:** Can be used to generate emails instantly, with the name of your choice.
* **Saves a lot of efforts:** Several temporary email generators are very hectic to use as they have high latency.
* **No limit on requests:** There's no limit to number of fetch requests.
* **Clean UI:** No longer visit those ad-frozen websites to generate temp mails.
* **Attachments support:** With this release, users will be able to download attachments on the mails received.
* **Longer disposable period:** The `1secmail` server provides a disposable time upto `120 minutes`.
* **Low latency requests:** Each request from the client responds within `<50ms`.
