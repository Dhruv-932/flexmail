Flexmail is a disposable temporary email generator, which can be used for wide range of purposes including protection from spammers.
Because of its privacy-related liberations, we keep the user data and usage stats private. 

* **Why this:** Can be used to generate emails instantly, with the name of your choice.
* **Saves a lot of efforts:** Several temporary email generators are very hectic to use as they have high latency.
* **Unlimited fetch requests:** There's no limit to number of fetch requests, and each request responds with the same reaction time being `<50ms`.
* **Clean UI:** Visit the web app once, you're gonna love it <3.
* **Attachments:** With this release, users will be able to download attachments on the mails received.
* **Longer disposable period:** Most temp mail generators provide random email addresses difficult to remember, and have a limit of 10 minutes, we here provide an upper time limit of `60 minutes`.
